## üíª Project

This project is a web service that provides data about the Star Wars franchise, more specifically about the planets shown in the movies.

It was developed during the course [Automated Tests in Practice with Spring Boot](https://www.udemy.com/course/testes-automatizados-na-pratica-com-spring-boot/?referralCode=7F6C5AA14AE558497FE0), having focus on automated tests creation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The project requires a MySQL database, so it is necessary to create a database with the following commands:

```
$ sudo mysql

CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;

exit

$ mysql -u user -p

CREATE DATABASE starwars;

exit
```

During the tests, the database tables will be created automatically.

## üöÄ Build & Run
